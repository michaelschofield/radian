## Project Mission and Summary
Currently data practitioners are siloed and have no central way to share and discover data solutions, approaches and ideas. Additionally, their informal contributions on the open web are under-discoverable and under-valued.

We aim to:
* Create a central hub for data practitioners and learners to share and discover good stuff.
* Increase attribution and recognition for informal contributions.

## How to get Involved
We invite data practioners to share content and resources that are useful to their work and professional development. In their work data practioners regularly discover, create and curate content on the open web, such as tutorials, blog posts, etc. by telling us about it, we can make it more discoverable across communities. We seek editors-at-large to nominate and curate
